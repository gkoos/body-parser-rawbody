# body-parser-rawbody

A clone of emanuelecasadio/body-parser-rawbody which is a clone of the original Node.js body parsing middleware that supports
the rawBody field inside the Request. That package is abandoned and I upgraded some of its dependencies.

Note: do not use this package unless you _really_ need it. This solution
is quite memory-inefficient.
